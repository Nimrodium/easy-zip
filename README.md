# easy-zip
a more easy way to quickly compress and decompress zip files. 

i made this because the zip and unzip commands (mostly unzip) are for some reason SO confusing for me !!! 
i still have no idea how to use them and i have to look it up every single time. so i finally snapped and cooked up this quick rust program to zip stuff in a mentally sane syntax, its less feature rich but cmon be honest youre only ever unzipping and zipping, if youre using zip/unzip for anything else youre copying it from a command on ask ubuntu.
